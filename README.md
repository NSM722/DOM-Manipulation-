# Basic DOM Manipulation
This is a challenge from **MDN Web Docs** to create a simple shopping list example that allows one to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and button. 

When one adds an item to the input and press the button:
* The item appears on the list
* Each item has a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list
* The input is emptied and focused ready for the user to enter another item
